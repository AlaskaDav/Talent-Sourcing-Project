#### Background

Teron Corp, a leading technology firm was facing challenges in its talent acquisition strategies. While the company had a diverse pool of employees, the leadership was keen to understand which recruitment channels and background yielded the best talent. With the intent to refine its hirng strategies and ensure the acquisition of top perfroming candidates, Teron corp decided to reach me for my expertise to help provide answers to their problems with my insights and findings.

#### Tools Used 

- Microsoft Excel: for easy access the contents of the file and understanding of the components of the data.
    - [Download here](http://microsoft.com)
- Excel Cleaning functions : To carry ETL process on the data
- Pivot Table: For visualization and creating reports

#### ETL Processing

In the initial data preparation process, the following process was performed
1. Data Extraction: The extracting data file (.csv files) from Microsoft Excel was a clean data set with litle or no much adjustment. It was a single data file. 
2. Transformation process taken place involves:
   - Renaming the data file
   - Corverted the data into tables
   - Changing date data types to text
   - Created new columns for Month and Year respectively
4. Loading process involves loading the completely transformed and cleaned data into Pivot table to build dashboard for reporting and visualizations.
 
#### Key Insights to consider

1.	Which "Sources of Hire" produces the best-performing employees? And which positions should we focus on recruitment from these sources?
2.	Which "University" produces the best performing employee?
3.	Determining the "Previous Employers" employees that tend to perform better?
4.	Which "Sources of Hire" produces the most loyal employees?

#### Data Analysis Procedures:

- Downloaded the file from the site (.csv files in MsExcel).
- Loading and opened the data using Microsoft Excel for Cleaning and analysing the contents of the data
- Ensure data clarification and data validity.
- Created new sheets for my pivot analysis and the visualizations
- Created a new sheet for dashboard for report presentation. 
- Providing insights, presenting informations and advice.
- Creating outstanding reports for end user understanding, board of directors and shareholders.

#### Results and Findings
